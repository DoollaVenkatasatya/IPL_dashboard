Both the tables are connected by relationship with match no as variable in one to many

The slicer helps in filtering the data of selected team among dashboard

The pie chart “Non strike runs” depicts the score obtained through other scoring aspects

The pie chart “ratio of score” depicts the score totally made by the team including strike runs and bonus runs split into the type of runs

“Strikerate by match”  chart gives a perspective of score made per ball as an average of the entire match

“Match Played %” shows the no of matches played by that team in overall match count classified by match type
